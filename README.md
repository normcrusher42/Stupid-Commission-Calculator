a stupid math program made to lazily calculate my overall income from commissions
(along with other small factors like fees n conversions) so I don't need to use notepad && calculator ever again.

𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬:
Litorlee just a bunch of printfs with math in its parameter when needed. I was expecting this to be more complicated but turns out
I still am a dummy at code :D

There're probably better ways to do this but with what I can do now, this is an easy solution and I don't intend on designing this 
for public use as it's probably useless to many but myself. This is my first C side-project which I've completed in 2 hours and a half
so don't go violating me for anything I did stupid as I did program it stupidly. Hoping I find ways to improve it and make it more hooman-friendly with time 🤞

How to run:

```cc *.c | ./a.out```

yea just compile and run it ik its crazy bro believe me it's not arch-linux science
