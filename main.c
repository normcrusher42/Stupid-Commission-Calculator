/* 
a stupid program math program made to lazily calculate my overall income from commissions
(along with other small factors like fees n conversions) so I don't need to use notepad && calculator ever again.


𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬: 
It's gonna run similarly to printf (probably gonna reuse n tweak my printf function) except it won't need type specifiers 
nor Variadic Functions as the whole point is to NOT rewrite the numbers again but instead append new variables to existing ones
(meaning I'd have to edit the code a bit featuring a new variable). 

There're probably better ways to do this but with what I can do now, this is an easy solution and I don't intend on designing this 
for public use as it's probably useless to many but myself (or anyone alike).

edit : NVM my function doesn't handle float pointers so screw that
